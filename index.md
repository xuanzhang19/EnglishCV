### ***Biography***  
&emsp;Dr. **Xuan ZHANG** is an Associate Professor in the Department of Energy and Power Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). He received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University (THU) in 2014 and 2019, and worked at Tsinghua University and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as a Postdoctoral Researcher before joining Beijing Institute of Technology in 2022 as a member of **[<u>Frost Lab</u>](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/FrostLab)**.  

&emsp;Dr. ZHANG focuses on the mechanisms and applications of heat/mass transfer and fluid flow coupling processes, especially phase change problems (e.g., icing/frosting/freezing, condensation/evaporation/boiling, solidification/melting). He has published/co-authored 90+ SCI journal papers on Science, Nature Communications, Cell Reports Physical Science, Nano Letters, Nano Energy, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, Chemical Engineering Journal, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Applied Thermal Engineering, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, Physics of Fluids, Applied Physics Letters (with 40+ papers being first/corresponding authors and 7 selected as ESI Highly Cited, Featured, Editor’s Pick, and Front Cover papers) and 4 books/chapters, given 7 invited reports in conferences, and applied for/authorized 20+ patents and softwares. His works have been cited by 2500+ times in Google Scholar with a h-index of 28 and have been reported by famous science and technology media, such as The New York Times, EurekAlert! (a news website operated by the American Association for the Advancement of Science), Phys.org and Tech Xplore (two branches of Science X Network focusing on science and technology), Scienmag, Bioengineer, People's Daily, and China Science Daily. He has also been granted several talent programs, such as Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by Beijing Municipal Association for Science and Technology, International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program, Postdoctoral Supporting Program by Tsinghua University, and listed among the **World's Top 2% Scientists** by Stanford University (since 2023).

&emsp;Dr. ZHANG has received 10+ research/teaching fundings from National Natural Science Foundation of China, Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Aeronautical Science Foundation of China, Open Fund of National Key Laboratory, etc. He has served as (Early-Career/Youth) Editors/Editorial Board Members for Clean Energy Science and Technology (Scopus)， 工程科学学报 (EI), etc., as subject Editor for Recent Patents on Mechanical Engineering (EI), as Guest Editors for Applied Thermal Engineering (SCI, JCR Q1), Micromachines (SCI, JCR Q2), Measurement & Control (SCI, JCR Q3), Energies (SCI, JCR Q3), Frontiers in Energy Research (SCI, JCR Q3), Thermo (ESCI), AppliedMath (ESCI), etc., as Conference Committee Members for Frosting-Icing 2025, MSTP-2024、Frosting-icing 2024、CMAAE 2024、MEACM 2024、ICMEM 2023, and as Reviewers for 60+ academic journals. He has also been awarded National First-Class Undergraduate Course (Ministry of Education of China), National Outstanding Online Open Course (Ministry of Education of China), Featured High-Quality Course for Engineering Masters and Doctors (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China), Wu Zhonghua Outstanding Graduate Student (Chinese Society of Engineering Thermophysics), Outstanding Doctoral Thesis (Tsinghua University), and Best Presentation Awards (Chinese Society of Power Engineering, JSPS, BeijingAssociation of Refrigeration).
